# LibraryManager

This is a simple library management system developed in Django. 

The admin user name and passwords are:\
username: admin \
password: pass1234

The normal user user name and passwords are:\
username: username \
password: password

Only the admin can add, remove and edit the books.\
Normal users can sign up and login and when logged in can borrow or return books.


I hope you enjoy.
